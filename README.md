# life-counter
This is a little life counter for Magic The Gathering I wrote while
learning angular webdev. It uses AngularJS for data binding, and
Angular Material for theming. The site is very basic, and is designed
to be used on a phone/tablet, but does work on a device like a laptop
aswell.

When the site is being viewed in portrait, it is assumed that the site
is being viewed on a phone, and it flips one player's life counter
upside down so that each counter is facing a player.
